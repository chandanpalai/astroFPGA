Tasks
- Ethernet (GigE?)
	- send/receive data between PC + FPGA
	- FSM to synchronize data transfer from PC to FPGA
	- Image processing 
	- feature detection
	- NCC feature matching

	Final Goals
	- For Demo
	- Video of image processing results previously acquired
in real-time field test (10 FPS)
	- Cameras send images to CPU for rectification, CPU uses
	ethernet to send images FPGA, FPGA outputs coordinates
	of correspondence points
